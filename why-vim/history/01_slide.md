# Core points #

* Every epic programmer (with some minor error here) uses either vim or emacs
* Using one of these two text editors will absolutely make you a better
  coder.
* Emacs is kind of cool but it's more an OS than a text editor.  Flame
  on?
* Which of the two you pick is a stylistic thing, but this talk's about
  vim.

# History (if you care) #

* vi was written by Bill Joy in 1976.  He co-founded Sun Microsystems.
  He's a somewhat epic programmer.  He was responsible for the first BSD
  Unix.
* the lack of cursor keys on the terminal that Bill Joy used inspired
  the h,j,k,l movement mechanism.

# History (cont) #
* Because it was in the original BSD Unix release (as ex at the time,
  but they're the same program), vi is in every unix anywhere.  You can
  always trust that it will be on your server.  It's actually in the
  Single UNIX Specification, so anything that claims to be UNIX must
  include it.

# History (cont) #
* vim is "Vi iMproved", and was released by Bram Moolenaar in 1991.
  It's charityware, and you're encouraged to donate money to children in
  Uganda if you like it :)  The license is compatible with the GPL.
* gvim is a graphical version of vim that has better color support and
  may be easier for newbies.  MacVim is like gvim for macs.
